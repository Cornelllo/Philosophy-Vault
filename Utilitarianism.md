In [[ethical philosophy]], utilitarianism is a family of normative ethical theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being for the affected individuals. In other words, utilitarian ideas encourage actions that ensure the greatest good for the greatest number.

Utilitarianism is a normative ethical theory that posits that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure and minimizes overall pain or suffering. It is a form of [[consequentialism]], which means that the moral worth of an action is determined by its outcome or consequences. Utilitarianism focuses on the results of actions rather than on the intentions behind them or the intrinsic nature of the actions themselves.

Key concepts and principles of utilitarianism include:

1. **The Principle of Utility**: This is the core idea of utilitarianism, often summarized by the phrase "the greatest happiness for the greatest number." It suggests that an action is right if it promotes the greatest amount of happiness and wrong if it produces the opposite.
    
2. **Hedonism**: Utilitarianism is grounded in the idea that happiness (or pleasure) and the absence of suffering (or pain) are the only intrinsic goods. All other values or goods are valuable only insofar as they contribute to happiness or reduce suffering.
    
3. **Impartiality**: Utilitarianism requires that each person's happiness counts equally. The well-being of every individual affected by an action is to be considered without giving preferential treatment to any particular person.
    
4. **Consequentialism**: The theory is consequentialist because it judges actions based on their outcomes. The rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by the net happiness or unhappiness it produces.
    

### Types of Utilitarianism

There are several variations of utilitarianism, including:

1. **Act Utilitarianism**: This form of utilitarianism assesses each individual action based on whether it maximizes happiness. An action is considered right if it produces the best possible consequences in that specific situation.
    
2. **Rule Utilitarianism**: Instead of evaluating individual actions, rule utilitarianism focuses on rules that, if followed, generally lead to the greatest good. An action is right if it conforms to a rule that, if universally followed, would maximize happiness.
    
3. **Preference Utilitarianism**: This variation takes into account the preferences or interests of individuals rather than focusing solely on pleasure and pain. An action is right if it satisfies the preferences or desires of the greatest number of people.
    

### Historical Background

Utilitarianism was developed and popularized by several key philosophers:

- **Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832)**: Often considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, Bentham introduced the principle of utility and proposed a quantitative approach to measuring happiness, known as the "felicific calculus."
    
- **John Stuart Mill (1806–1873)**: A student of Bentham, Mill refined and expanded utilitarianism, addressing criticisms and emphasizing qualitative differences in pleasures. Mill argued that intellectual and moral pleasures (higher pleasures) are superior to mere physical pleasure (lower pleasures).
    

### Criticisms of Utilitarianism

Despite its influence, utilitarianism has faced various criticisms:

1. **Quantifying Happiness**: Critics argue that it is difficult, if not impossible, to measure and compare the happiness or suffering resulting from different actions accurately.
    
2. **Ignoring Justice**: Utilitarianism can, in some cases, justify actions that seem intuitively wrong or unjust, such as sacrificing one innocent person to save many others.
    
3. **Demandingness**: The theory can be seen as overly demanding, as it requires individuals to constantly act in ways that maximize overall happiness, potentially at significant personal cost.
    
4. **Agent-Neutrality**: Utilitarianism requires individuals to treat their own interests and those of others impartially, which some argue conflicts with natural human inclinations to prioritize personal relationships and commitments.
    

Despite these criticisms, utilitarianism remains a central and influential ethical theory, widely discussed and debated in both philosophical and practical contexts.
