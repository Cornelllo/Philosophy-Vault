Ethical philosophy, also known as moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy that deals with questions about what is morally right and wrong, good and bad, fair and unfair. It explores the nature of ethics, moral principles, and values that guide human conduct. Ethical philosophy seeks to provide systematic approaches to understanding, analyzing, and resolving moral issues.

Here are some key aspects of ethical philosophy:

1. **Normative Ethics**: This branch is concerned with establishing how things should be and what people ought to do. It involves creating or evaluating moral standards. The primary questions it seeks to answer are:
    
    - What is the right thing to do?
    - What are the moral duties and obligations?
    - What kind of person should one strive to be?
    
    Major theories in normative ethics include:
    
    - **[[Utilitarianism]]**: The view that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure.
    - **[[Deontology]]**: The belief that actions are morally right or wrong based on their adherence to rules and duties.
    - **Virtue Ethics**: Focuses on the character and virtues of the individual, rather than on specific actions.
2. **Meta-Ethics**: This branch examines the nature of moral judgments, the meaning of moral terms, and the metaphysical status of moral values. It addresses questions like:
    
    - What does it mean to say something is "good" or "bad"?
    - Are moral values objective (independent of human feelings and beliefs) or subjective (dependent on individual perspectives)?
3. **Applied Ethics**: This area deals with the practical application of ethical principles to specific moral issues. It involves analyzing and resolving moral dilemmas in various fields such as:
    
    - Medical ethics (e.g., euthanasia, medical confidentiality)
    - Business ethics (e.g., corporate responsibility, fair trade)
    - Environmental ethics (e.g., conservation, animal rights)
4. **Moral Psychology**: This branch explores how people come to hold moral beliefs and how these beliefs influence their behavior. It integrates insights from psychology and cognitive science to understand moral development, moral emotions, and moral decision-making.
    
5. **Descriptive Ethics**: Unlike normative ethics, descriptive ethics is concerned with describing how people actually behave and what moral beliefs they hold. It involves empirical research to gather data on people's ethical views and practices.
    

Ethical philosophy has been shaped by many influential thinkers throughout history, such as:

- **Aristotle**: Known for his work on virtue ethics.
- **Immanuel Kant**: A key figure in deontological ethics.
- **John Stuart Mill**: A proponent of utilitarianism.

Overall, ethical philosophy is a vital field that seeks to understand and guide human behavior, helping individuals and societies navigate complex moral landscapes.
